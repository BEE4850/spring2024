Scientific hypotheses;\n    - Modeling and statistical choices\n- In-class presentation before spring break\n- **5850 Students**: Write a referee report\n\n## Homework Assignments\n\n- More in-depth problems\n- Roughly 2 weeks to complete\n- Will not drop any by default\n- Regrade requests must be made within one week\n- **5850 Students**: Some extra problems\n\n## Term Project\n\n- Analyze a data set of interest using model(s) of your choice\n- Can work individually or groups of 2\n- Several deliverables throughout the semester\n- Final in-class presentation and report\n\n\n## Attendance\n\nNot required, but students tend to do better when they're actively engaged in class.\n\n\n## Office Hours\n\n- MW 10-11 AM, 318 Riley-Robb\n- Almost impossible to find a time that works for all (or even most); please feel free to make appointments as/if needed.\n\n## Accomodations\n\nIf you have any access barriers in this class, *please* seek out any helpful accomodations.\n\n- Get an SDS letter.\n- If you need an accomodation before you have an official letter, please reach out to me ASAP!\n\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\nHopefully not a concern...\n\n- Collaboration is great and is encouraged! \n- Knowing how to find and use helpful resources is a skill we want to develop. \n- Don't just copy...learn from others and give credit.\n- Submit your own original work.\n\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\nObviously, just copying down answers from Chegg or ChatGPT and passing them off as your own is not ok.\n\n\n## ChatGPT: The Stochastic Parrot\n\nThink about ChatGPT as a drunk who tells stories for drinks.\n\nIt will give you plausible-looking text or code on any topic, but it doesn't know anything beyond what it \"overheard.\"\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\nChatGPT can be useful for certain tasks (*e.g.* understanding code errors), but may neglect context for why/when certain information or solutions work.\n\nJust think about it as an unreliable Google search.\n:::\n\n# Class Tools\n\n## Communications\n\nUse [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org) for questions and discussions about class, homework assignments, etc.\n\n- Try to use public posts so others can benefit from questions and can weigh in.\n- **I will make announcements through Ed**.\n\n## Email\n\nWhen urgency or privacy is required, email is ok.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nPlease include **BEE4850** in your email subject line! This will ensure it doesn't get lost in the shuffle.\n\nBetter: Use Ed Discussion and reserve email for matters that are particular urgent and/or require privacy.\n:::\n\n## Course Website\n\n<https://viveks.me/simulation-data-analysis>\n\n- Central hub for information, schedule, and policies\n- Will add link and some information to Canvas (assignment due dates, etc)\n\n## Computing Tools\n\n- Course is programming language-agnostic.\n- Assignments will have notebooks set up for Julia (environments, etc) on GitHub.\n\n## Some Tips For Success\n\n- Start the homeworks early; this gives time to sort out conceptual problems and debug.\n- Ask questions (in class and online) and try to help each other.\n- Give me feedback!\n\n# Upcoming Schedule\n\n## Next Classes\n\n**Wednesday**: Hypothesis testing and data analysis\n\n**Next Week**: Review of uncertainty and probability\n\n## Assessments\n\n**Homework 1** available; due *next* Friday.\n\n**Exercise 1** due *this* Friday.\n\n# References\n\n## References (Scroll for Full List)\n\n",
