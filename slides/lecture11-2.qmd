# Class Overview

## What We've Done

- Develop probability models consistent with data-generating processes;
- Simulate from probability models (Monte Carlo)
- Calibrate (fit) models to data and quantify uncertainties (bootstrap, MCMC).

## What's Left?

- Assessing evidence/model selection
- *Maybe*: Emulation and surrogate modeling

# Hypothesis Testing

## What Is Hypothesis Testing?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Is a time series stationary?
- Does some environmental condition have an effect on water quality/etc?
- Does a drug or treatment have some effect?
:::

## Example: Storm Surge Nonstationarity

**Standard Extreme Value Models (GEV/GPD)**: No long-term trend in the data (extremes follow the same distribution)

This is an example of a **null hypothesis**: no meaningful effect.

## Example: Storm Surge Nonstationarity

**Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a long-term trend in the data.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
How can we draw conclusions about whether apparent trends are "real" (alternative hypothesis) or noise (null hypothesis)?
:::

## Hypothesis Testing Notation

- $\mathcal{H}_0$: null
- $\mathcal{H}$: alternative

## San Francisco Tide Gauge Data

#| code-fold: true
#| code-overflow: wrap

#| fig-cap: Annual maxima surge data from the San Francisco, CA tide gauge.

# load SF tide gauge data
# read in data and get annual maxima
function load_data(fname)
    date_format = DateFormat("yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS")
    # This uses the DataFramesMeta.jl package, which makes it easy to string together commands to load and process data
    df = @chain fname begin
        CSV.read(DataFrame; header=false)
        rename("Column1" => "year", "Column2" => "month", "Column3" => "day", "Column4" => "hour", "Column5" => "gauge")
        # need to reformat the decimal date in the data file
        @transform :datetime = DateTime.(:year, :month, :day, :hour)
        # replace -99999 with missing
        @transform :gauge = ifelse.(abs.(:gauge) .>= 9999, missing, :gauge)
        select(:datetime, :gauge)
    end
    return df
end

dat = load_data("data/surge/h551.csv")

# detrend the data to remove the effects of sea-level rise and seasonal dynamics
ma_length = 366
ma_offset = Int(floor(ma_length/2))
moving_average(series,n) = [mean(@view series[i-n:i+n]) for i in n+1:length(series)-n]
dat_ma = DataFrame(datetime=dat.datetime[ma_offset+1:end-ma_offset], residual=dat.gauge[ma_offset+1:end-ma_offset] .- moving_average(dat.gauge, ma_offset))

# group data by year and compute the annual maxima
dat_ma = dropmissing(dat_ma) # drop missing data
dat_annmax = combine(dat_ma -> dat_ma[argmax(dat_ma.residual), :], groupby(transform(dat_ma, :datetime => x->year.(x)), :datetime_function))
delete!(dat_annmax, nrow(dat_annmax)) # delete 2023; haven't seen much of that year yet
rename!(dat_annmax, :datetime_function => :Year)
select!(dat_annmax, [:Year, :residual])
dat_annmax.residual = dat_annmax.residual / 1000 # convert to m

# make plots
p1 = plot(
    dat_annmax.Year,
    dat_annmax.residual;
    xlabel="Year",
    ylabel="Annual Max Tide Level (m)",
    label=false,

    bottom_margin=5mm

n = nrow(dat_annmax)
linfit = lm(@formula(residual ~ Year), dat_annmax)
pred = coef(linfit)[1] .+ coef(linfit)[2] * dat_annmax.Year

plot!(p1, dat_annmax.Year, pred, linewidth=3, label="Linear Trend")
```

## Non-Parametric Statistics for Non-Stationarity

**Mann-Kendall Test**: Assume data is independent and no periodic signals, but no specific distributional assumption

$$S = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j={1+1}}^n \text{sgn}\left(y_j - y_i\right).$$

SF Tide Gauge Data: $S=921$.

## Parametric Statistics for Non-Stationarity

Fit a regression 

$$
\begin{gather*}
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \varepsilon_i, \\
\varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2\mathbb{I}).
\end{gather*}
$$

SF Tide Gauge Data: $\hat{\beta} \approx (1.26, 4 \times 10^{-4})^T$

## Statistical Significance

Is the value of the test statistic consistent with the null hypothesis?

More formally, could the test statistic have been reasonably observed from a random sample **given the null hypothesis**?

## Statistical Significance

***Note***: Statistical significance does not mean anything about whether the alternative hypothesis is "true" or an accurate reflection of the data-generating process.

More clever null hypothesis setups can get around this, but they aren't the default.

## Non-Parametric Null Hypothesis

$\mathcal{H}_0: S = 0$ (no average trend).

The sampling distribution of $S$ consistent with that hypothesis is
$$S \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{n(n-1)(2n+5)}{18}\right).$$

SF Tide Gauge Data: $Var(S) = 224875$

## Parametric Null Hypothesis

$\mathcal{H}_0: \beta_1 = 0$ (time does not explain trends).

Use the $t$-statistic:

$$\hat{t} = \frac{\hat{\beta_1}}{se(\hat{\beta_1)}},$$  $\hat{t} \sim t_{n-2}$.

SF Data: $t = 2.31$.

    <td>False </td>

    <td rowspan="2">**Decision About Null Hypothesis**</td>
    <td>Don't reject</td>
    <td>True negative (probability $1-\alpha$)</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reject</td>
    <td>Type I Error (false positive, probability $\alpha$)</td>
    <td>True positive (probability $1-\beta$)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Type I and Type II Errors

The standard null hypothesis significance framework is based on balancing the chance of making **Type I (false positive)** and **Type II (false negative)** errors.

**Idea**: Set a significance level $\alpha$ which is an "acceptable" probability of making a Type I error.

**Aside**: The probability $1-\beta$ of correctly rejecting $H_0$ is the *power*.

## p-Values

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
The **p-value** captures the probability that, **assuming the null hypothesis**, you would observe results **at least as extreme as you observed**.

## p-Value and Significance

If the p-value is sufficiently small (below $\alpha$), we say that we can reject the null hypothesis with $1-\alpha$ confidence, or that the finding is statistically significant at the $1-\alpha$ level.

This can mean:

::: {.fade-in .fragment}
1. The null hypothesis is not true for that data-generating process;
2. The null hypothesis *is* true but the data is an outlying sample.
:::

## What p-Values Are Not

::: {.incremental}
1. Probability that the null hypothesis is true;
2. Probability that the effect was produced by chance alone;
3. An indication of the effect size.
:::

## Aside: p-Values

## SF Tide Gauge Data

For the SF tide gauge data, the p-value for the Mann-Kendall test is 0.5. 

::: {.incremental}
- What can you conclude?
- What can't you conclude?
:::

## SF Tide Gauge Data

The p-value for the coefficient of the time-varying term in a regression is 0.02.

What can/can't you conclude?

## What is Any Statistical Test Doing?

1. Assume the null hypothesis $H_0$.
2. Compute the test statistic $\hat{S}$ for the sample.
3. **Obtain the sampling distribution of the test statistic $S$ under $H_0$.**
4. Calculate $\mathbb{P}(S > \hat{S})$ (*the p-value*).

## Some Criticisms of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

::: {.incremental}
- Does a dichotomy between $H_0$ and $H$ make sense?
- What are the implications of (not) rejecting $H_0$?
- Why was the significance level chosen?
:::

## What Might Be More Satisfying?

::: {.incremental}
- Consideration of multiple plausible (possibly more nuanced) hypotheses.
- Assessment/quantification of evidence consistent with different hypotheses.
- Insight into the effect size.
:::

# Model Selection as Hypothesis Testing

## Model Assessment Through Simulation

If we have a model which permits simulation (through Monte Carlo or the bootstrap):

1. Calibrate models under different assumptions;
2. Simulate realizations from those models;
3. Compute the distribution of the relevant statistic $S$ from these realizations;
4. Assess which distribution is most consistent with the observed quantity.

## Advances of Simulation for "Testing"

- More structural freedom (don't need to write down the sampling distribution of $S$ in closed form);
- Don't need to set up a dichotomous "null vs alternative" test;
- Models can reflect more nuanced hypotheses about data generating processes.

## How Do We Assess Models For Selection?

Generally, through **predictive performance**: how probable is some data (out-of-sample or the calibration dataset)?

But there are also metrics of how well you explain the existing data (RMSE, R^2^).

# Key Points

## Hypothesis Testing

- Null Hypothesis Significance Testing: Compare a null hypothesis (no effect) to an alternative (effect)
- $p$-value: probability (under $H_0$) of more extreme test statistic than observed.
- $p$-values are often over-interpreted, with negative outcomes!
- "Significant" if $p$-value is below a significance level reflecting acceptable Type I error rate.
